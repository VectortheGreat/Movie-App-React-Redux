# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Usage

1. Open the terminal and enter the command `npx json-server --watch src/api/db.json` first. It will fetch data from the json-server.
2. Then, run the command `npm run start`. Now you can use the movie-app.

# Description

This is an example React-Redux project by me. I didn't focus on CSS, so it might not look great, but I have learned a lot of React-related concepts with this project, such as Hooks, Redux, Axios, and more.
